      Terms & conditions User-generated content: submitting material for
      publication The Conversation only publishes material submitted by
      registered users. We accept no liability in respect of any material
      submitted by users and published by us, and we are not responsible for its
      content and accuracy. The views expressed are the personal opinions of the
      experts named. They may not represent the views of The Conversation or any
      other organisation unless specifically stated. The Conversation attempts
      to provide a range of views from the academic and research community.
      Users may submit material for publication under the following terms and
      conditions: Publication of any material you submit to us will be at our
      sole discretion. We reserve the right to make additions or deletions to
      the text or graphics prior to publication, or to refuse publication. You
      grant us a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide
      licence to publish and communicate to the public any material you submit
      to us in any format, including without limitation print and electronic
      format. You also agree that we may permit other parties to publish and
      communicate to the public any material you submit to us in any format. You
      warrant that any material you submit is your own original work and that
      you own the copyright and any other relevant rights. If you would like to
      tell us about material that isnt your copyright and which we may want to
      use, please tell us who owns it so we can ask permission to republish. You
      warrant that the material you submit is not obscene, offensive or
      otherwise illegal. You agree not to submit material that is deliberately
      intended to upset other users. You will take reasonable steps to ensure
      that any material you submit is not defamatory of any person. If you
      suspect that material may be defamatory (or if you are not sure), you must
      tell us at the time you submit the material to us. You acknowledge that
      any breach of these conditions may cause us damage or loss. You agree to
      indemnify us in full and permanently against any third-party liabilities,
      claims, costs, loss or damage we incur as a result of your breach of
      conditions (2) to (6) above. You must act honestly and in good faith in
      your dealings with us and (if requested) you must provide us with
      reasonable assistance to settle, defend or investigate any third party
      claims arising as a result of our publication of material you submit to
      us. We reserve the right to remove your access to individual services
      completely if we believe you are abusing the services in any way.

      below), which expand on the points above and are incorporated in these
      Terms of Service. You will be deemed to consent to these guidelines if you
      choose to post any content or comments to the site. General principles for
      authors, disclosure and peer review The Conversation is committed to the
      highest standards of integrity and professional conduct. Authors have a
      duty to ensure that their work maintains the good name of The Conversation
      and that of the academic and research community. The Conversation requires
      authors to disclose any potential conflict of interest. A conflict exists
      where an individuals interests diverge from their professional
      responsibilities such that an independent observer might reasonably
      conclude that the author has been unduly influenced by their own interest.
      Publication must include information on the sources of financial and
      in-kind support for the research, and must reveal actual or potential
      conflicts of interest. Research, as a general principle, should not be
      reported before it has been subjected to a recognised process of peer
      review. Registration When you register, you are registering as a personal

      create additional registration accounts for the purpose of abusing the
      site or other users; nor do you seek to pass yourself off as another user.

      you have not complied with these requirements, we may, at our discretion,
      cancel your access to the registration areas of theconversation.com

      agreement will terminate and your email address and password will become
      invalid on theconversation.com immediately. How to complain and
      corrections The Conversation strives to maintain the highest editorial
      standards at all times. However, we do not always get things right. Should
      you feel it necessary to correct or complain about an article, the means
      for doing so are contained below. The Conversation strives for fairness
      and accuracy at all times, and we encourage users to advise us of any
      significant errors. When commenting on The Conversation, you are like our
      guest at our dinner party. Youve been invited into our space and we ask
      that you behave with respect and courtesy to help us create a positive
      fact-based discussion. These are the ground rules: We treat our comments
      streams as a curated editorial product. We reserve the right to publish or
      remove comments to make the conversation better Comments are only open on
      selected articles and are typically open for 72hrs We require your real

      real name using your Conversation profile page. Stay on-topic. Comments
      should be relevant to the article and replies relevant to the initiating
      post. We reserve the right to delete off-topic comments We reserve the
      right to delete any comments including: personal attacks, all forms of
      discrimination, posts identifying or sharing the personal information of
      another person (including children), comments that are commercial or
      repeatedly-shared external links, comments that are defamatory, breach
      copyright or put us in legal jeopardy, deliberate attempts to misinform,
      distort facts, provoke or misrepresent the opinions of others, the thread
      of replies if the original comment is deleted; and other comments at
      editorial discretion We reserve the right to lock accounts, in particular
      where commenters repeatedly breach standards Disputes We wont review
      routine moderation decisions, but if you do need to discuss anything,
      contact our Community Manager: moderation@theconversation.com FAQs Who is
      allowed to comment? All readers of The Conversation can log in and
      comment. Commenters must use real names. Can commenters remain anonymous?
      No, we have a strict real names policy. Anonymity will only be allowed in
      exceptional circumstances. To discuss an anonymous post please contact the
      Community Manager: moderation@theconversation.com How do commenters log
      in? Create a Reader Profile by clicking on Sign In at the top right of the
      home page. How does The Conversation verify commenters? We ask that
      commenters to be honest and use a real name. If you log on via an account
      like Twitter or Google, please enter your real name on your profile page
      and use a real name, not a pseudonym or social media handle. From time to
      time, we may ask users to verify their identity using a trusted, third
      party site. Who reviews comments? The Conversations editors moderate
      comments. Readers and other commenters can report comments for our editors
      to review. In short: if you act with consideration for other users, you
      should have no problems. Take some responsibility for the quality of the
      conversations in which youre participating. Help make this an intelligent
      place for discussion. Moderation and Reporting Abuse All community
      interaction is subject to some level of moderation to ensure the spirit of
      the community standards is upheld. In general, we will primarily rely on
      visitors to post-moderate community interaction to keep the conversation
      lively. However, because of the sheer quantity involved, this
      unfortunately means we cant guarantee all comments live on the site are
      appropriate or in the spirit of our community standards. Reporting abuse.
      While our staff will try to keep an eye on all community activity, we will
      rely on our users to report abusive, offensive or otherwise inappropriate
      comments when they appear by clicking on the “report abuse” link that
      appears next to each comment. This alerts us to problems and areas of
      concern to the community, which means we can make the space better for
      everyone: were grateful for your help with this. Participants who
      seriously, persistently or wilfully ignore community standards,
      participation guidelines or terms and conditions will lose their posting
      privileges. This is not an action that we take lightly or arbitrarily.
      However, we are aiming to create and maintain an online experience
      consistent with the high value we place on civilised debate, and we
      reserve the right to make decisions that we feel support that. Please be
      aware that moderators may contact you by email in relation to your
      participation, especially where an issue comes up in relation to these
      community standards. Any advice they give/request they make should be
      adhered to, as our moderators are asked to enforce these community
      standards and create a constructive environment for everyone who
      contributes to our site. We will, when necessary, remove user postings or
      comments. If a contribution is perceived as breaching the community
      guidelines set out above, then it will be removed by the editorial team,
      in the interests of keeping community areas of the site appropriate for
      the vast majority of the people who visit. (Note: We will not edit user
      posts to change the meaning, spelling, or anything else intended by the
      user. Even if only part of a comment or posting is perceived as breaching
      community guidelines, the whole thing may be removed. Also, when a comment
      or post is removed for any of the reasons above, it is sometimes necessary
      to delete subsequent messages that refer to explicitly or quote from the
      original (removed) comment to preserve the conversational thread. This may
      also happen because a later comment quotes directly the problematic bits
      of the original comment, which just perpetuates the problem. In such cases
      not every deletion will be marked individually.) What control do authors
      have on comments? None. Authors cant moderate comments on their own - or
      anyone elses - articles. If an author wants a particular comment removed,
      he or she should click on the “report abuse” and the comment will be
      assessed by the moderation team in due course and dealt with accordingly.
      We reserve the right to take steps or implement measures that we hope will
      benefit the whole community of participants. Because we are ultimately
      responsible for everything that appears on this site, all actions and
      decisions taken by our moderators are final. Unfortunately, the quantity
      of user content means we cant enter into correspondence regarding specific
      moderation activity, although all correspondence will be read. Last
